            <p>Tightly CO 10 STS on each of 4 DPNs using the Single Cast On method. Do not weave in
                your tail; you will use it to keep track of the <code>BOR</code>. (40sts)</p>
            <p>NOTE: <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Knitting-Lessons-Cast-On-Techniques/" target="_blank">Single Cast On Method</a>. To adapt this pattern for other yarn weights or foot sizes change the number of
                your CO STS this way: knit a stockinet test swatch that will fit around your leg- when you knit it
                in ribbing for the actual sock, it will be tighter/stretchy and fit.</p>
            <p>You can either rib in a K1, P1 or K2, P2 pattern, BUT the first row all knit stitches are KTBL.
                Your ribbing rows should be knit tightly so your socks will stay up and have some stretch.
                Rib as long as you want, but for at least 1”. After an inch, you can continue ribbing
                pattern, or change to another design pattern. End your row at the BOR/CO tail.</p>
            <p>NOTE: To avoid ladders between DPNs, pull tightly on the last and successive first 2 STS
                between needles.</p>


        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Heel"> 
            <header>Heel</header>
            <h5>Part 1</h5>
            <p>K to the end of the 3rd needle (30 STS of round).</p>

            <p>Row 1 (RS): K the next 2 needles (last and first needles of your round) onto one
                needle. This will be 20 STS on one DPN and now your three DPNs will make a triangle.
                You will only be working on these 20 STS for this section to form the heel.</p>
                
                <p>Row 2 (WS): Turn your work and K2, P16, K2. (This ribbing pattern will help you count
                your rows.)</p>
                
                <p>Row 3 (RS): K across</p>
                
                <p>Repeat Rows 2 & 3 for 17 rows counting by the 9 P rows end on a WS.</p>
                
                <p>RS: Next, divide STS on this needle by 3 and PM between each section with any
                remainder STS placed in the center section.</p>
                
                <p>For our sample, 20 STS/3 = 6 with 2 STS remaining. Set up for this needle will be: K6,
                PM, K8, PM, K6 – the 2 remainder STS stay in the middle section.</p>

            <h5>Part 2</h5>
            <p>WS P across and slip markers when you come to them.</p>

                <p>NOTE : In this section, K every ST to the 1st ST before the 2nd marker. (or K6, SM, K7)
                Slip the last ST before the 2nd marker to the R needle, then K the next ST of the last
                set and PSSO to dec 1 ST.</p>
                
                <p>Turn your work. Slip 1 ST knitwise (because we already worked a dec on that ST on
                the WS). K to 1 ST before the next marker; slip last ST before marker to R needle. K
                next ST and PSSO. (1 ST dec)</p>
                
                <p>Turn your work. Slip the 1st ST (again, this is the dec from the prior row); P to 1 ST
                before the 2nd marker and then (again, the last ST + the 1st ST). (1 ST dec)
                Turn your work. Slip the 1st ST. K to 1 ST before the marker. Slip 1 ST; K next ST,
                PSSO (1 ST dec).</p>
                
                <p>Turn your work. Slip 1st ST. P to 1 ST before marker; P2TOG. (1 ST dec)
                Turn your work and repeat. Always keep 8 STS in the middle/between the 2
                markers. End on a WS row when only 8 STS remain.</p>

            <header>Top of foot, Toe and Cast Off</header>
            <p>Turn to RS. Slip 1st ST. K3 (or half of the STS on this needle) & you’ll be back to the CO tail. K
                remaining ST on that needle back onto the 4th DPN.</p>
                
                <p>Pick up STS up the heel – one for every K row. (Total number does not matter; we will
                resolve that in the next row). K to next side of heel & pick up same number of STS in same
                manner. K last heel STS onto this needle. And now you will notice you are back to the <code>CO/BOR</code>.</p>
                
                <p>*K to last 2 STS on the next needle. Slip 1 ST to R needle, K next ST and PSSO (1 dec). K next 2
                needles. K2TOG next 2 STS. K remaining STS on that needle, and you will be at the BOR now.*
                Repeat between * until 10 STS remain on each needle (or whatever your CO count was per needle)</p>
                
                <p>NOTE: An easy way to remember this part of the pattern is: At the end of needle 1 = slip, K,
                slip. At the beginning of needle 4 = k2tog.</p>
                
                
                
                    <p>K around until the length of the foot reaches the top of the little toe.</p>
                
                        <p>NOTE: You can use a sock ruler or charts on shoe sizes to know what this length should
                be.</p>
                
                <p>DEC on the sides of the foot on each needle in this manner:<BR>
                Row 1: K to 3 STS remain on needle; slip 1, K1, PSSO, K1<BR>
                Row 2: K1, K2TOG, k remaining STS</p>
                
                <p>Repeat Rows 1 & 2 until 2 STS remain on each needle. Cut your yarn with a long tail.
                Thread tail through these last 8 STS, secure and weave in end.</p>
